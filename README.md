Title: Text Analyzer

Description: Text Analyzer is a web application built using React.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to input text and perform various operations, including converting text to uppercase or lowercase, removing extra spaces, and counting the number of words and characters. Additionally, the app features both light and dark modes for improved accessibility.

This project showcases my skills in web development, particularly in working with React.js, Node.js, and various front-end technologies. Through this project, I learned how to build a user-friendly and responsive web app that provides practical functionality to users. The code is open-source and available on GitHub, allowing others to view and learn from my implementation.
